## 📌 **About the Challenge**  

The idea behind this challenge is simple:  
1. Code every day for 100 days.  
2. Work on projects, learn new concepts, and build consistency.  
3. Share my journey to inspire and connect with others.  

This is my personal journey to grow as a developer, stay motivated, and challenge myself to keep learning.
